This is a two player game. 
The game is played on an 8 x 8 grid. 
Player 1 uses white pieces and player two uses black pieces 
NOTE Pieces are black on one side, and white on the other. 
"Flipping" a piece means that a piece it changes color and belongs to the other player). 

The game starts with two black and two white pieces in a square in the exact centre 
of the board such that the white pieces are diagonal from each other and the black 
pieces are diagonal from each other (see starting positions image). 

The players alternate turns from now on. 

1) Player 1 puts a white piece on the board such that:
    i) It is on the same row, column or diagonal as his or her own piece (white)
    ii) Makes it so that there is one of Player 2's pieces (black) between it 
	and his or her existing piece (white) on the same column, row or diagonal. 
	(see legal moves image) 
	
2) Player 2's piece (black) existing between two of player 1's pieces is 
    Flipped and is now white and now belongs to player 1. 
    
3) This process is repeated with both players alternating turns until the board 
    is filled up or one player owns all of the existing pieces on the board. 
    
3) If one player owns every piece, they win. If the board is filled, the player
    with most pieces will win. If both players have an equal number of pieces, 
    there is a draw.
